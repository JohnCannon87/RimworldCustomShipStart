# GravshipExport
Update/Rewrite of my previous Gravship export mod, much easier now and instead of building a lot of hard to understand XML just click a few buttons and have the game generate it for you !

## Features
* Export your Gravship direct from in game, includes all buildings and attached things, but not Pawns or Items (**<ins>HINT</ins>** Make sure you have some Shelves on ships you export (might even need some Vanilla ones) otherwise your starting items might not spawn !
* Pick a Gravship you've exported, from my built in examples or from other people who've made a mod from a ship they've designed and start the game with that Gravship instead !
* Take a ship you've exported and export it further to be it's own mod ! The exporter builds your About.xml and if there's already a preview image for your ship will copy it into the right place with the right name for you, You can then publish that to the steam workshop yourself to share with others :)
* Preview images when available
* Platform will be extended all around the ship at start, so even larger ships should be supported, obviously there will be a limit however due to map edges and the starting map being quite small

## Mod Compatibility
In theory it should be compatible with everything, if you're using an exported mod from someone else then you will need any mods they decided to include on the ship otherwise the thing won't spawn and might throw an error.

## Known Issues
* It's annoying but I can't seem to get the game to take a screenshot of your Gravship itself, There's some guidance in the UI for where to place a screenshot you can take but if anyone know's how to do this please help out :D
* You can't save floors :( The way base game RimWorlds spawning works for the initial Gravship you can only place one TerrainDef and that [i]has[/i] to be the Substructure, I might be able to fix this one day but for now consider it a flaw in the "Gravship Exporter Customer Service Division", they just don't like carpets
* When your ship spawns any rooms without a pawn in them will show as unexplored, time to walk around and discover what your ship came with, hey look, a cup holder !

# The Point Of This Mod
As with all my mods I made this for myself and decided to share it, I wanted a simple and easy way to start with a nicer ship at the beginning, I won't be adding any major features like delayed ship spawning etc. Yes this mod can make your play through incredibly easy, but you could also make it harder, it's up to you !

# Future Plans
* Get automatic screenshots working
* Enable a "Random Ship" mode where you can select a few ships and the game will pick one at random for each game start.
